# AdvanceMyShop

Customize every aspect of your pricing system: discounts, markups, and multipliers â€” all fully configurable to align with your game view. Your store, your rules: take control and optimize for comfortable experience.

## Configuration

Use mod manager of your preference or [REPOConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/nickklmao/REPOConfig/) to edit mod settings.

I strongly suggest to tailor those settings to your liking, because everyone see game different.

### Available options

## Compatibility

Mod was made to be compatible with other mods that change shop pricings, however I can't guarantee it because of my "skill issue". If you encounter strange behaviour AFTER this mod have been installed, please report it.

Mod was tested with `37` mods installed, including ones that change multipliers.
