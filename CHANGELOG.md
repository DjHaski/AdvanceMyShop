## v1.1.0

- Improved compatibility with other mods changing various multipliers? Idk
- `Percentages` now supports `float` type (e.g. `1.5` or `0.25`).
  - `Percentages` now populated with smaller numbers by default to decrease chance of "buy all shop for nothing" thing to occur.
- Added `OverpriceMultiplier` to increase problems when overpricing occurs. Have fun with that lol.
- Increased `FreeItemChance` from `0.3%` to `0.5%` by default.
- Added `OverpricedItemChance` (default is `0.5%`) which will multiply item cost by `OverpricedItemMultiplier` (default is `5`).
- Boring code chore. I want it to look pretty, what!?
